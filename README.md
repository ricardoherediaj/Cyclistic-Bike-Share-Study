# Cyclistic-Bike-Share-Study
This corresponds to the first capstone project of the Google Data Analytics Certificate where I performed many real-world tasks of a junior data analyst. I chosed RStudio as my working tool in order to follow the steps of a guided roadmap to complete the data analysis process: ask, prepare, process, analyze, share, and act.
